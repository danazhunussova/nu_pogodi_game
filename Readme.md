Dear nFactorial Incubator Admission Committee,

I am thrilled to apply to one of the greatest IT programs of this summer as this is an amazing chance to develop my hard skills, learn a lot of new things, launch new projects, exchange ideas and connect with many IT enthusiasts. I have been waiting for an opportunity to become a part of the Incubator since last summer when I first discovered it. I believe that my aspirations as well as programming skills totally align with nFactorial Incubator's vision. 

Becoming a part of this community would certainly give me a chance to develop in the IT sphere, innovate, and aspire proffessional goals. I have a great experience in coding, software development, front-end development as well as good background knowledge. I have completed a range of educational courses on data structures and algorithms in c/c++, web development bootcamp, programming in c, python. Last year, I had several projects: for example, working as a web-developer and making a responsive website, working for a software development company, and being an intern in Astana hub. I believe that my technical skills make me a great-fit candidate for nFactorial. 

Getting into nFactorial Incubator would be a golden opportunity to make a step forward in the sphere. If I become accepted to the Incubator, I promise to contribute to the success of the program and make a valuable impact in the industry. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward for your positive reply.
